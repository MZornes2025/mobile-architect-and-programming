# Mobile Architect and Programming

## Overview
This project is a mobile application built as part of my Computer Science coursework at SNHU.  
It demonstrates my ability to design, implement, and test a functional app with modern programming practices.  

The app allows users to [brief feature summary: ex. create accounts, track tasks, or interact with data in X way].  

## Technologies
- Language: Java
- Tools: Android Studio
- Paradigms: Object-Oriented Programming, MVC design pattern

## My Contributions

- Integrated data persistence with [SQLite / Firebase / JSON storage].
- Designed UI screens and workflows to improve usability.
- Tested and debugged across multiple devices and emulators.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open in Android Studio.
3. Run on an emulator or connected device.

## Notes
- This was a structured project with starter files, but all core logic and functionality listed above were implemented by me.
- Built during Summer 2025 as part of my degree in Computer Science.
