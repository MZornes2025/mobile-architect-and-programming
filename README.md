## Professional Self-Assessment

This ePortfolio represents my journey through the Computer Science program, showcasing my growth into a professional software developer. Through enhancing an Inventory Management Android application, I demonstrate technical proficiency, analytical thinking, and security-minded development.

## üì± App Overview

The **Inventory App** is an Android application designed to help warehouse employees efficiently track and manage inventory items. The app provides a secure login system, intuitive inventory grid layout, comprehensive item management capabilities, and SMS notifications for low stock alerts.

### Primary Goals
- Secure user authentication and account management
- Real-time inventory visibility with visual indicators
- Streamlined item management (add/remove/update quantities)
- Automated low stock notifications via SMS
- Mobile-optimized interface for warehouse environments

### User Needs Addressed
- Reduced manual tracking errors and paperwork
- Immediate visibility into stock levels across warehouse
- Timely alerts for restocking needs
- Mobile accessibility for on-the-go inventory management
- Simple, intuitive interface requiring minimal training

## üé® User-Centered Design

### Screens & Features

| Screen | Key Features | User Benefit |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Login** | Secure auth, password obscuring, dual login/registration | Quick access, account security |
| **Dashboard** | Grid layout, color-coded quantities, action buttons | At-a-glance inventory status |
| **SMS Permissions** | Contextual explanation, graceful denial handling | Informed permission decisions |

### Design Philosophy

The UI was designed specifically for warehouse workers:
- **Large touch targets** for glove compatibility
- **Color-coded visual indicators** for quick status assessment
- **Streamlined navigation** minimizing required taps
- **Consistent Material Design** themes for intuitive interaction
- **Logical focus order** matching natural workflow patterns

## üíª Development Approach

### Implementation Strategy
- **Incremental development** with core navigation first
- **UI before logic** methodology for early visual validation
- **Modular component design** for reusability
- **Progressive enhancement** with thorough testing at each stage

### Technical Architecture
App Structure:

MainActivity (Login/Registration)

DashboardActivity (Inventory Management)

SmsPermissionActivity (Notifications)

RecyclerView with Custom Adapter

SQLite Database for local storage


### Skills Demonstrated

- **Software Design & Engineering:** Refactored codebase, eliminated duplication, implemented professional coding standards
- **Algorithms & Data Structure:** Optimized performance with DiffUtil, implemented robust input validation  
- **Databases:** Secured user data with BCrypt password hashing, implemented database migrations
- **Collaboration & Communication:** Partnered on code review, authored technical narratives

### Course Outcomes Achieved

- ‚úÖ Employ strategies for building collaborative environments
- ‚úÖ Design and deliver professional-quality communications
- ‚úÖ Design computing solutions using algorithmic principles
- ‚úÖ Use innovative techniques and tools in computing practices
- ‚úÖ Develop a security mindset to ensure data privacy and security
